# Swift openGL experiments
Just me experimenting with swift + openGL. Credits go to chatGPT for assisting with all of this

## TODO:
- [x] Pyramids rotate randomly when they move
- [x] Ability to shoot a pyramid that will explode into multiple pyramids after a timeout
- [ ] Pyramids leave a trail of smaller pyramids. This trail should show the path of the pyramids
- [ ] Add control to change the velocity vector of the pyramids while they are moving
- [ ] Experiment with lightting
- [ ] Rendering to texture. I would like to render some of the shadertoy shaders to a polygon
